{"info":{"title":"AppFolio Reports API","description":"API Documentation for the AppFolio Reports APIs.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThe AppFolio Reports API utilizes \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\" target=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\"\u003eREST\u003c/a\u003e, allowing you to query and manage data stored in Reports.  \nWe use \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\" target=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\"\u003eHTTP Basic Auth\u003c/a\u003e for authentication, and ``application/json`` to format requests and responses. \n### **Basic POST request using the Reports API**\n\nFor an API call to be successful in the curl request below, you must enter a valid **resource**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **database**.\n\n1. Enter a resource in the curl request below. For example, the name of the *Purchase Order* Report's path is `purchase_order.json`. Refer to each Report's code sample for the correct resource name associated with it.\n\n2. Retrieve your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.\n\n- In the AppFolio Property Manager, select your account name drop-down → General Settings → Manage API Settings.\n- Select the **Reports API Credentials** tab. Here, if you have not already done so, select **Generate New Credentials**.\n- Your Client ID and Client Secret will appear within the Credentials card. The credentials will be stored in this location and can be referenced here once generated.\n\n3. Insert your Client ID, Client Secret, database URL and report name into the sample curl request below.\n\n```\ncurl --request POST 'https://{ClientID}:{ClientSecret}@{your-database}.appfolio.com/api/v2/reports/{report_name}.json'\n```\n4. Optionally enter a **body** for your request to specify which filters you want to apply. See the report payload examples on the right. A successful request will return a list of the desired resources.\n\n## Migrating from V1 to V2 of the Reports API\n\nThere is a dedicated help article for migrating from V1 to V2 which details differences between the two versions. That document can be found \u003ca href=\"https://help.appfolio.com/s/article/Requesting-Data-from-AppFolio-Data-API-V2\" target=\"https://help.appfolio.com/s/article/Requesting-Data-from-AppFolio-Data-API-V2\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## Rate Limits\n\nTo prevent network congestion and avoid `429` **Too Many Requests** errors, we recommend regulating or staggering the rate of your requests. All endpoints have the same rate limits configured, except for the next_page_url, which is not subjected to any rate limits.\n\nCurrently, the rate limits are as follows:\n\n- **7 requests per 15 seconds**\n## Pagination\n\nA next page URL value will be returned along with the results of your report when the response contains many rows. The next page URL will contain information about this offset and the existing results of your report run. You can send a POST request directly to this URL to fetch subsequent sets of up to 5,000 rows. We encourage using the next page URL when fetching large sets of data as response times will be considerably faster than generating a new report run. We do not rate limit requests that use this next page URL. Since the next page URL references existing report run results, any changes to filters will not be applied - to avoid confusion here, we do not allow providing filters when using the next page URL in V2.\n\nNext page URLs point to existing results, which are valid for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes you will receive an error message if you attempt to access those results and need to re-run the report with filters to generate new results.\n\nAlternatively, next page URL and the 5,000 row limit can be ignored by providing the flag `paginate_results = false`. This can result in a lot of data being returned and may take several seconds for the request to complete. You should only use this if it is absolutely necessary and should always include a date range filter to limit the response size. Please note that very long running queries can time out. If you include a `paginate_results=false` in your request, your response will NOT include the results under a 'results' key - the response payload will just be an array of rows.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe AppFolio Reports API returns HTTP status codes. The following error codes are possible.\n| Error Code | Text | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `400`      | Bad Request       | The request was not processed due to invalid syntax.|\n| `401`      | Unauthorized      | HTTP Basic: Access denied.|\n| `404`      | Not Found         | The requested resource could not be found. |\n| `406`      | Not Acceptable    | The request did not specify the correct headers (i.e. ContentType: application/json). |\n| `429`      | Too Many Requests | The partner has sent too many requests. |\n| `500`      | Unexpected Error  | The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented a successful request. This is usually a temporary state.\n\n## Data Types\n\nThe API accepts and produces some common data types as described below.\n\n| Type | Format | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| Amount | \"[0-9]+\\.[0-9][0-9]\" | All amounts should be strings with two decimals (assume USD). |\n| Date | \"YYYY-MM-DD\" | All dates should be strings in the ISO 8601 format. |\n| DateTime | \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\" | All times should be strings in the ISO 8601 format in UTC. |\n| Number | integer | All integers values are returned as numbers. |\n| String | UTF-8 | All other values are returned as strings in UTF-8 format. |\n\nSee individual API end points for additional details, notes, and exceptions.\n\n# Best Practices\n\nTo maximize efficiency and ensure the reliability of your Reports API usage, review the following best practices.\n\n### **Request Body**\n\nSome of the reports available through the API require certain filters to issue a successful request. The following bullet points list the name of the Report, and what filter is required when using it.\n\n- Balance Sheet: The **properties** filter is required.\n\n- Check Register Detail: The **from_date** filter is required.\n- Deposit Register: The **from_date** and **to_date** filters are required.\n- Payment Plans: The **from_date** filter is required.\n- Prospect Source Tracking: The **from_date** filter is required.\n- Receivables Activity: The **from_date** filter is required.\n- Rental Applications: The **from_date** filter is required.\n- Survey Responses: The **from_date** filter is required.\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\nWhen troubleshooting issues associated with the AppFolio Reports API, ensure you can answer _Yes_ to the following questions in the checklist. If you answer _No_ to any of the following questions, it is likely that you have found the problem.\n\n1. **Is the URL correct?**\n\n- A valid URL should look similar to `https://vhost.appfolio.com/api/v2/reports/{endpoint}`.\n\n2. **Were the correct credentials passed in the request?**\n\n- We strongly recommend ensuring the correct credentials were passed in the initial request.\n\n3. **Is the authorization header valid?**\n\n- Ensure the formatting of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** passed into your authorization header are valid.\n\n5. **Are the request parameters valid?**\n\n- If an incorrect parameter value was passed, the returned error codes should be descriptive enough to assist you in identifying the problem.\n\n6. **Is the rate at which you are issuing requests regulated?**\n\n- In general, staggering the rate at which you issue requests will prevent network congestion and errors.\n","version":"2.0.0","license":{"name":"proprietary"}},"servers":[{"url":"https://{vhost}.appfolio.com/api/v2/reports","variables":{"vhost":{"default":"qa.qa","description":"This variable specifies the customer's vhost ie https://south.appfolio.com"}}}],"security":[{"apiCredentials":[]}],"produces":["application/vnd.api+json"],"openapi":"3.1.0","basePath":"/api/v2/reports","schemes":["https"],"components":{"schemas":{"AccountTotalsRequest":{"type":"object","required":["gl_account_ids","posted_on_from","posted_on_to"],"properties":{"property_visibility":{"type":"string","description":"The property visibility to filter by.","enum":["active","hidden","all"],"default":"active","example":"active"},"properties":{"type":"object","description":"The property filter.
